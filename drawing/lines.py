# Helper functions for playing with how the turtle draws

# This module contains some fancy code that we don't expect you to understand 
# yet. That's ok--as long as we know how to use code, we don't have to 
# understand everything about it. (Do you understand everything about 
# MacOS?) Check out the README for documentation on how to use this code. 

# Of course, if you want to dig into this module, feel free. You can ask a 
# teacher about it if you're interested.
